- Write a program that will
- Ask the user for their first name
- Ask the user for their last name
- Ask the user for their age
- Display their full name in a LName, FName format.
- Print the year the user was born
- If the user is under 18, print that the user is too young to vote
- If the user is under 21, print that the user is old enough to vote, but too young to drink
- If the user is between 21 and 65, print that the user is old enough to vote and drink
- Otherwise, print that the user qualifies for social security
- When you write your program, try to put some of these things into functions.
- Another hint : You might run into errors when you calculate the year of birth â€“ this is because you have to type cast the variable types!
Be sure to write internal documentation as well
